# Global GPD Data Exploration
This project explores global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) data by nation and continent from 1999 through 2019 in Excel using ANOVA testing and regression analysis. Using this data, we can see that there is sufficient evidence that there are significant differences in mean of national and continental GDP.

Regression Analysis on GDP Data (U.S. vs. Global)
![Regression Analysis - U.S. vs. World GDP](https://github.com/bwayvs/GlobalGDP_DataExploration/blob/main/images/Regression%20Analysis%20Global%20GDP.PNG)
I pulled raw data from USDA website and ran a regression analysis on the U.S. vs. the rest of the world, using Excel's Data Analytics toolbox.

Aggregated Continental GDP Data

This is the aggregated continental GDP data pulled from individual countries as part of the preparation for further analysis. The numbers have been condensed to show GDP in the millions ($).

Numerical Summary of Data

I calculated the means, standard deviation and variances of the sample. 

Checking for Constant Variance and Nomality

I created a dynamic Q-Q plot that can be updated for each of the 6 continents. Here, we see that North America's sample data has a normal distribution. I also checked for contant variance to ensure there were no predictible patterns in the variance. With this information, I can move on to the hypothesis testing. 

ANOVA Hypothesis Testing

Having met all the requirements for ANOVA testing, the data was ready for further analysis. Using an f-test, I was able to determine the P-value was very small. This tells us that at least one mean continental GDP was different than the others. 

Means Plot of Continental GDP Data

Using a means plot, I was able to determine the liklihood that Group 4 (Asia) had a much higher GDP mean than other continents. 

## ðŸš€ About Me
I am a junior data analyst at an international law firm. I believe data tells us more than numbers. It helps us to understand the relationships between various elements, identify patterns and predict trends. I enjoy using data analysis to identify solutions to business problems.
